Project 3:
Implementing Chord

Good afternoon,

In order to build and run the project type the following command:

    sbt "run numNode numRequests"

numNodes is a positive integer.

numRequests is the number of times each node will query for a random message.

Please include the quotation marks as well.




All features are implemented and working. Output will be displayed in the terminal.
The largest network we tested was 10,000 nodes.
COP5615Project3.pdf is included in this directory.

Enjoy.
